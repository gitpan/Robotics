Robotics::Tecan
Robotics::Tecan::Genesis
Robotics::(vendor)::(model)

This is the perl module for controlling laboratory
robotics & peripheral devices in either industrial
laboratory or homebrew environments.  Provides easy-to-use
software interface to the physical robots and allows
programming the robots at a higher level.  Provides
network communication using a client-server for
manufacturers which provide third-party applications to
access the robot; this allows a remote computer running
this module to communicate to the robot's computer running
this module.

* Support for Tecan Genesis is provided.

* Support for other Perl CPAN modules is under discussion,
such as: LEGO Mindstorm, Microchip UBW, etc.

* Support for other devices and manufacturers is open for
discussion or contributon (author is available for funded
work - email to discuss).  

This module requires: 

  Robotics hardware; may require physical connection
  (serial port or USB, etc) from the Perl computer to the
  robot, or may require internet connection.  For network
  communication, this module uses IO::Socket.

  There may be simulation modes available (so hardware is
  not required) however simulation of the robotics is not
  the goal -- getting them physically working is!

NO WARRANTIES:  Author(s) are not responsible for physical
damage to hardware or people!  WATCH OUT.  (All user
applications you write should also include warnings prior
to executing movement as a general guideline.

Namespace note:  The name "Robotics" is used rather than
"Robot" since there are many perl software modules for
internet / web / script automation which are incorrectly
called "robots".  The more correct term for such labelled
software is "user software agent" or simply "agent".
